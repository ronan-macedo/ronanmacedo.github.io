                <p>
                    The essential idea of a temple is and ever has been that of a place specially set apart for service 
                    regarded as sacred; in a more restricted sense, a temple is a building constructed for and exclusively 
                    devoted to sacred rites and ceremonies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Latin templum was the equivalent of the Hebrew beth Elohim and signified the abode of Deity; 
                    hence it meant literally the house of the Lord.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such structures have been raised in many different ages, both by worshippers of idols 
                    and by the followers of the true and living God. While the outer courts of such temples 
                    were used as places of general assembly and public ceremony, there were always inner 
                    precincts into which only the consecrated priests might enter and wherein, it was claimed, 
                    the presence of the deity was manifest. Temples have never been regarded as places of ordinary 
                    public assembly but as sacred enclosures consecrated to the most solemn ceremonials of that 
                    particular system of worship.

                <p>
                    “Why are so many willing to give so much in order to receive the blessings of the temple? 
                    Those who understand the eternal blessings which come from the temple know that no 
                    sacrifice is too great, no price too heavy, no struggle too difficult in order to 
                    receive those blessings. There are never too many miles to travel, too many obstacles 
                    to overcome, or too much discomfort to endure. They understand that the saving ordinances 
                    received in the temple that permit us to someday return to our Heavenly Father in an 
                    eternal family relationship and to be endowed with blessings and power from on high are 
                    worth every sacrifice and every effort.”
